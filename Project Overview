# Collision-Avoidance-Mobile-Bot

This was a Team Project. There were 5 team members. 
This Project was given to us during Summer Training and Internship at IIT Kanpur.
Topic of the training was: AI IoT and Robotics.

Schematics of the project was given to us( uploaded here in this repository).
We collected data manually that further will be used to train the Machine Learning Model and get weights for VL(Left wheel Velocity) and VR(Right wheel velocity)
We used Raspberry Pi to control the PWM outputs of DC Motors using a python program.
